# Bank Tech Test - JavaScript

## Project description
The aim of this project is to build a tech test for a bank which allows a user to interact with their bank account, allowing the user to make deposits, withdraws and be able to view their whole statement which gives them a complete list of their debits, credits and total balance.

Having been able to build and model the program in Ruby, to get some time writing JavaScript and get better at it, I have decided to try again and write the program in JavaScript.
